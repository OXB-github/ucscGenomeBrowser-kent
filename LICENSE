The default license of this repository is the MIT License, but LICENSE files in
subdirectories override the text of this LICENSE file.

Therefore the code in this repository is covered by five different licenses:

FREE Licenses:

1. the default MIT license (attached below) for code in src/ and most subdirectories
  - this directory includes all code to build and use tools and libraries to
    read and write the Genome Browser file formats, such as bigBed and bigWig, and
    the command line tools for these, bedToBigBed, wigToBigWig and the tagStorm
    tools and the parasol job scheduler.
  - also, third-party code from open-source projects bundled for convenience,
    in src/htslib (MIT), and ./src/optimalLeaf (public domain, with attribution).
  - the directories src/hg/autoSql and src/hg/autoXml have MIT LICENSE files, so they are also 
    under the MIT License
2. A modified BSD license for src/htslib/cram/, see src/htslib/LICENSE. 
   Copyright (C) 2012-2014 Genome Research Ltd.
3. Public domain "with attribution" license, see src/optimalLeaf/LICENSE

NON-COMMERCIAL licenses:

4. A non-commercial license from UC for the genome browser website code in src/hg/ 
   and subdirectories (see src/hg/LICENSE), see https://genome.ucsc.edu/license/
5. A non-commercial license from Kent Informatics for the BLAT and isPCR code in src/blat/ and
   src/jkOwnLib/, for more information see https://genome.ucsc.edu/license/ and http://www.kentinformatics.com/

See https://genome.ucsc.edu/license/ for more details and on how to obtain a license
for commercial use for the cases (4) and (5). Commercial users should contact
kent@soe.ucsc.edu for access to other modules including jkOwnLib and blat.

Commercial users interested in the UCSC Genome Browser in particular please see
    http://genome.ucsc.edu/license/.

The code in src/htslib is distributed with two licenses as noted in the LICENSE
file in that directory.
