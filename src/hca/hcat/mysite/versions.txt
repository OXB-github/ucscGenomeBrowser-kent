0.1 - Got Django 2.1 admin running on hgwdev and proof of concept that
      the multiple selects on many-to-many fields work there.  Made
      basic Contributor, Lab, Project, Grant tables and a few of the
      biologically relevant tables in first draft.  Showed to Clay.
0.2 - Went through Clay's wish list and got through about 3/4 of the
      stuff we have control over.  There's lots of tables for things
      like organs, assays, and project state.  The controlled vocabs
      are managed by a separate table for the vocab in question that
      the wranglers can extend.  People can put comments on most things.
0.3 - Figured out how to set up file uploads so that people can download
      a file after it's uploaded.  Used this for holding the excel
      spreadsheets and other key files for wranglers.  Got through
      the other 1/4 of Clay's wish list.  Polished up the project
      details page a bit to condense it again with all the recent
      additions.  Changing 'vocab' to 'wrangler' as a prefix for the
      tables most people should ignore, and figured out how to do 
      this without changing the table names.
