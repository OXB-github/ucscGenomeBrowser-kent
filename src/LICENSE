MIT 

The default license of this repository is the MIT License, but LICENSE files in
subdirectories override the text of this LICENSE file for files in certain
subdirectories. This allows us to keep all functionally related code together
in the same repository.

As a result, the code in this repository falls into three different license types:

1 OSI OPEN SOURCE: the default MIT license (below) applies to the large majority of the code.
  - this includes all code to build and use tools and libraries to
    read and write the Genome Browser file formats, like bigBed and bigWig, and
    the command line tools for these, bedToBigBed, wigToBigWig and the tagStorm
    tools, the parasol job scheduler, tools to process out file formats, like
    pslCDnaFilter, pslFilter, pslToChain, overlapSelect and featureBits and 
    hundreds of others.
  - also, patched third-party code from open-source projects bundled for
    convenience, in src/htslib (MIT), and ./src/optimalLeaf (public domain,
    with attribution).

2 NON-COMMERCIAL UCSC: A non-commercial license from UC for the genome browser website code in
  selected subdirectories of src/hg, see src/hg/LICENSE and https://genome-store.ucsc.edu/

  - for source code under directories in src/hg:
   cgilib hgApi hgCollection hgFileSearch hgFileUi hgGateway hgGene
   hgGenome hgIntegrator hgPal hgPcr hgPhyloPlace hgPublicSessions hgSession
   hgSuggest hgTables hgTrackUi hgTracks hgVai hgc hubApi near visiGene liftOver

3 NON-COMMERCIAL Kent: A non-commercial license from Kent Informatics for the
  BLAT code in src/blat/ and src/jkOwnLib/, see http://www.kentinformatics.com/

  - for source code under directories: src/blat/ and src/jkOwnLib

See https://genome.ucsc.edu/license/ for more details and on how to obtain a license for (2) and (3)

The first line of all LICENSE files specifies the license for all files in subdirectories under it
in SPDX format.
