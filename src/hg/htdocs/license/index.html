<h1>Graphics: No permission is needed to reproduce a graphic produced by the Genome Browser</h1>
<p>Permission is granted for reuse of all graphics produced
by the UCSC Genome Browser website. There is no need to contact us to get permission. If your 
publisher, notably Elsevier, insists on getting approval, please direct them to this webpage. 
However, when you use the UCSC Genome Browser in your work, please cite one of our 
<a href="../goldenPath/pubs.html">publications</a>.</p>
<br>

<h1>Data: No license is needed for the data files and database tables used by the Genome Browser</h1>
<p>
As far as the UCSC Genome Browser group is concerned, the raw table data and binary
files used to create the graphics by the browser is freely available for both
public and commercial use. This applies to data that is downloaded as files via 
http, https, ftp or rsync, and equally when data is accessed through 
the public MySQL server or via the web API.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, the source databases or authors place restrictions on the data. In very rare
cases, the genomes come with citation requirements. The README.txt file in the
download directory of each assembly shows the
original restrictions pertaining to the genome
sequence itself by the original authors; most assemblies do not have any restrictions.
</p>
<p>
Certain genome annotation data, mostly on the human
genome and in the domain of clinical genetics, have specific restrictions.
Usually the data must be obtained from the source database directly in the
original format or licensed, rather from UCSC. Examples are HGMD, LOVD, OMIM, Decipher,
Genomenom, Genehancer and COSMIC, as well as any GISAID-derived data on viral
genomes. Please see the respective track documentation pages on these
assemblies for more details, by selecting the assembly and clicking the track
title in the genome browser.</p> <br>

<h1>Software: Commercial use of the Genome Browser software and related tools available
from our website and source code repository</h1>
<p>When using applications on the Genome Browser website, including LiftOver and BLAT, or
data from the UCSC Genome Browser database in a research work that will be published in a journal
or on the Internet, there is no need to get permission from us. 
Download of these utilities is subject to license terms.
When you use the UCSC Genome Browser in your work, 
please cite one of our <a href="../goldenPath/pubs.html">publications</a>.
</p>
<p>
Aside from publications, the Genome Browser binaries and source code are freely
available for academic, nonprofit, and personal use. A license is required for
commercial download and installation of
most Genome Browser binaries and source code, with the exception of the items
in the section <a href="#free">"Software: Tools and directories freely
available for all uses"</a> below. BLAT and isPCR, if needed, are covered by a
separate license (see below).
</p>

<p>
To purchase a commercial license for Genome Browser source code, LiftOver, GBiB, or GBiC, please 
visit the <a href="https://genome-store.ucsc.edu">Genome Browser store</a>. </p>

<p>
