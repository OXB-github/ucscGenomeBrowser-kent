<h2>The basics</h2>
<h6>What is a gene?</h6>
<p>
Before DNA sequencing, genes were defined as heritable traits. In the present day context of 
bioinformatics, a gene represents a collection of transcripts usually transcribed within certain 
genomic coordinates . Transcripts either encode one protein or are non-coding transcripts. 
For human, most genes have an associated symbol assigned by the Human Gene Nomenclature 
Commitee (HGNC, formerly HUGO). For other organisms there is usually a database curation 
team that assigns symbols, such as MGI for mouse.
</p>

<a name="genestrans"></a>
<h6>What is the difference between a gene and a transcript? </h6>
<p>
Transcripts are defined as RNA molecules that are copied from a DNA template of a gene. Every gene 
is comprised of a set of transcripts. In the Genome Browser, data tracks are often called 
"Genes", e.g. "Ensembl Genes" or "UCSC Genes", but they really represent transcripts 
on an assembly. Every transcript has an accession number, a sequence, and a list of exon
chrom/start/end coordinates on a genome assembly. These transcript accession numbers 
are assigned to genes. </p>

<h6>What are the most common gene transcript tracks?</h6>
<p>
Originally, researchers sequenced cDNA sequences, submitted them to Genbank and the
Genome Browser shows these in the Genbank track, or in the EST track, if the cDNA is just
a single read from the 5' or 3' end. From the alignment of the cDNAs and ESTs, 
the NCBI RefSeq group manually creates a smaller set of representative transcripts.
Automated programs like UCSC's or Ensembl's gene build software do the same, just
in software, which is more systematic but more error-prone.
With the arrival of GENCODE, Ensembl added a manual curation to their
human and mouse transcripts. NCBI has since also added automated predictions pipeline with 
their tool Gnomon and its resulting "Refseq Predicted" transcripts.</p>

<p>There are many other tracks in the group "Genes and Gene Predictions".
Genescan and N-Scan are older transcript predictor algorithms that are based on
only the genome sequence alone. Augustus and AceView are automated
gene-predictors that use cDNA and EST data. Most of these and similar gene
tracks are only relevant when you are working on a particular locus where you
think that the manually curated gene models (Ensembl and RefSeq) have
errors.</p>

<a name="genename"></a>
<h6>What is a gene name? </h6>

<p>
The most common gene names encountered by users are either from Ensembl, GENCODE, RefSeq, or 
gene symbols. For gene symbols, such as DDX11L1, see the above question "What is a gene?".
Ensembl/GENCODE accession numbers in the human genome start with ENST followed by a
number. Every transcript is assigned to a gene with identifiers that start with ENSG and 
every ENSG has at least one ENST assigned to it. Manually curated RefSeq transcript identifiers
start with NM_ (coding) or NR_ (noncoding), followed by a number, or XM_ if
they are predicted by software.</p>

<a name="ens"></a>
<h2>The differences</h2>
<h6>What are Ensembl and GENCODE and is there any difference?</h6>

<p>TODO Lou or Max: compare the Ensembl GFF with the Gencode GFF.</p>

<p> 
On the most current human and mouse genome assemblies (hg38 and mm10), and the primary chromosomes
(not alternate sequences or patches (LINK TO EXPLAIN WHAT THIS IS?) the
identifiers, transcript sequences and exon coordinates of equivalent Ensembl
and Gencode versions are almost identical. Gencode uses the UCSC convention of prefixing
chromosome names with "chr", e.g. "chr1" and "chrM", but Ensembl calls these
"1" or "MT". At a time of writing (Ensembl 89), a few transcripts differ due to
conversion issues. In addition, around 160 PAR genes are duplicated in Gencode
but only once in Gencode. The differences affect fewer than 1% of the
transcripts. Apart from gene annotation itself, the links to external databases
differ. 

The <a target=_blank
href="https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/releases.html">Gencode Release
History</a> shows the release dates and can be linked to corresponding Ensembl
releases.  You can download the gene transcript models from the website
<a href=https://gencodegenes.org>https://gencodegenes.org</a> or from
<a href=http://ensembl.org>http://ensembl.org</a>. 
For many applications, the files distributed on the Gencode website
should be easier to use, as the third party database links are easier to parse
and the sequence identifiers match the UCSC genome files, at least for the
primary chromosomes.

<a name="ensRefseq"></a>
<h6>What are the differences among Ensembl, Gencode and RefSeq?</h6>
<p> 
Different institutions have different rules on how they annotate genes. E.g.
RefSeq's criteria are more stringent, so there are a lot fewer RefSeq
transcripts than for Ensembl/Gencode. Also, RefSeq transcripts have their own
sequences independent of the genome assembly, so certain population-specific variants
may be in RefSeq that are entirely missing from the reference genome sequence.
The links from either transcript model to other gene-related databases are
different. In general, it seems that high-throuput sequencing data results,
e.g. RNA-seq, are often using Ensembl/Gencode annotations and human genetics
results are reported using RefSeq annotations. It depends on your particular
project which gene model set you want to use. Over time, the two transcript
databases are becoming more and more similar.

<a name="hg19"></a>
<h6>For the human assembly hg19/GRCh37: What is the difference between UCSC
Genes, the "GENCODE All" track and the "Ensembl Genes" track?</h6>
<p>The "UCSC Genes", also called "Known Genes" track, is available only on
assemblies before hg38.  It was built with a gene predictor developed at UCSC.
It uses protein, EST and cDNA annotations to derive a relatively restricted
gene transcript set. The software is not used anymore and the track is not
available on the newer assemblies.</p>

<p>The "Gencode All" track has all version of Gencode. "Ensembl Genes" contains just 
a single Ensembl version. See above for the differences between Ensembl and Gencode.</p>

<a name="hg38"></a>
<h6>For the human assembly hg38/GRCh38: What are the differences between the "GENCODE" and 
"All GENCODE" tracks?</h6>
<p> 
"Gencode" is the default gene track on hg38 (similar to "Known Genes" on hg19). It shows a lot of 
third party information when you click on a gene. "All Gencode" contains all
versions of Gencode, but a lot less third-party information.
</p>

<a name="gencode"></a>
<h6>What is the difference between "GENCODE Comprehensive" and "GENCODE Basic?"</h6>
<p> 
Gencode Basic is the subset of Gencode useful to most users and it is what the UCSC Genome
Browser shows by default.  
The "basic" tag is defined like this in the <a href="https://www.gencodegenes.org/pages/tags.html">Gencode FAQ</a>:
"Identifies a subset of representative transcripts for each gene; prioritises
full-length protein coding transcripts over partial or non-protein coding
transcripts within the same gene, and intends to highlight those transcripts
that will be useful to the majority of users.". </p>

<a name="ccds"></a>
<h6>What is CCDS?</h6>

<a name="justsingle"></a>
<h6>How can I just show a single transcript per gene?</h6>
<p> 
For the tracks "UCSC Genes" (hg19) or "Gencode Genes" (hg38), click on
their title and on the configuration page, uncheck the box "Show splice
variants". Only a single transcript will be shown. The method how this
transcript is selected is described in the track documentation below the 
configuration settings.</p>

<p>For the track NCBI RefSeq (hg38), you can activate the subtrack "RefSeq Clinical".
It contains only the transcripts that are part of the Human Gene Mutation Database.
</p>

<a name="whatdo"></a>
<h6>This is rather complicated. Can you tell me which gene transcript track I should use?</h6>
<p> 
For automated analysis, if you are doing NGS analysis and you need to capture
all possible transcripts, use Gencode.  For human genetics or variant
annotation, a more restricted transcript set is usually sufficient and "NCBI
RefSeq" is the standard. If you are only interested in protein coding
annotations, CCDS or UniProt may be an option, but this is rather unusual.<br>

For manual inspection of exon boundaries of a single gene, and especially if it
is a transcript that is repetitive or hard to align (e.g. very small exons),
look at the UCSC RefSeq track and watch out for differences between the NCBI
and UCSC exon placement. You can also BLAT the transcript sequence. 
Manually look at ESTs, mRNAs, TransMap and possibly Augustus, Genscan, SIB, SGP
or GeneId in obscure cases where you are looking for hints on what an
alternative splicing could look like.
