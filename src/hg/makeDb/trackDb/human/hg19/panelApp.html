<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The
<a target="_blank" href="https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/#!">Genomics England 
PanelApp</a>
tracks show virtual gene panels related to human disorders. Originally developed to aid 
interpretation of participant genomes in the 100,000 Genomes Project, PanelApp is now 
also being used as the platform for achieving consensus on gene panels in the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/genomics/nhs-genomic-med-service/">
NHS Genomic Medicine Service (GMS).</a> 
As panels in PanelApp are publicly available, they can also be used by other groups 
and projects. Panels are maintained and updated by 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/">Genomics England</a> curators.
<br>
<br>
Genes and genomic entities (short tandem repeats/STRs and copy number variants/CNVs) have been 
reviewed by experts to enable a community consensus to be reached on which genes and genomic 
entities should appear on a <b>diagnostics grade panel</b> for each disorder. A <b>rating 
system</b> (confidence level 0 - 3) is used to classify the level of evidence supporting 
association with phenotypes covered by the gene panel in question.
<br>
<br>
The available data tracks are: 
<br>
<br>
<b>Genomics England PanelApp Genes (PanelApp Genes)</b>: shows genes with evidence supporting a 
gene-disease relationship.
<br>
<br>
<b>Genomics England PanelApp STRs (PanelApp STRs)</b>: shows short tandem repeats that 
can be disease-causing when a particular number of repeats is present.

The individual tracks are colored by <b>confidence level:</b>

<ul>
<li><b><font color="#32CD32">Score 3 (lime green)</font></b> - <b>High level of evidence</b> for 
this gene-disease association. Demonstrates confidence that this gene should be used for 
genome interpretation.</li>
<li><b><font color="#FFBF00">Score 2 (amber)</font></b> - <b>Moderate evidence</b> for this 
gene-disease association. This gene should not be used for genomic interpretation.</li>
<li><b><font color="red">Score 0 or 1 (red)</font></b> - <b>Not enough evidence</b> for 
this gene-disease association. This gene should not be used for genomic interpretation. </li>
<br>
Mouseover on items shows the gene name, confidence level, mode of inheritance (if known) 
and phenotypes related to the gene. supporting evidence of dosage sensitivity. Tracks can be filtered 
according to the confidence level of disease association evidence. For more information
