<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The <b>${longLabel}</b> <b>(PEXT)</b> track set displays isoform expression levels across 53 
tissues, based on 11,706 tissue samples from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) v7 dataset.
</p>

<p>
The <b> gnomAD PEXT tracks</p> provide a comprehensive view of the expression of exons across a gene using 
the <em>proportion expression across transcripts</em>, or <em>pext metric</em>, a transcript-level 
annotation metric which quantifies isoform expression for variants. This metric was calculated by 
annotating each variant with the expression of all possible consequences across all transcripts for 
each tissue and normalizing the expression of the annotation to the total expression of the gene, 
which can be interpreted as a measure of the proportion of the total transcriptional output from a 
gene that would be affected by the variant annotation in question.
</p>

<p>
Each of the subtracks shows the <em>pext metrics</em> for a specific tissue, except the <b>gnomAD 
PEXT mean_proportion </b> subtrack which shows the average pext metrics calculated from the 53 
GTEx tissues.
</p>

<p>
Note that isoform quantification tools can be imprecise, especially for longer genes with many 
annotated isoforms. Regions with low pext values might be enriched for annotation errors (ie. there 
may be edge cases for which an exon that is established to be critical for gene function may appear 
unexpressed with pext). Also note that the GTEx dataset is postmortem adult tissue, and thus 
the possibility that an exon may be development-specific or may be expressed in tissues not 
represented in GTEx can not be dismissed.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
The pext graphs display the mean expression at each base position for protein-coding (CDS) regions.
While UTRs do have expression in transcriptome datasets, note that this information is not included 
for the visualization. The details page shows calculated sample percentages for the range of 
sequence within the browser window.
