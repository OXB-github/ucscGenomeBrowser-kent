<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows genetic variants likely affecting gene expression in multiple human tissues.
Specifically, the data displayed are the gene expression quantitative trait loci within 1MB of 
gene transcription start sites (cis-eQTL's) 
identified as causal in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project V6 release by 
CAVIAR analysis (95% credible set).  The track shows eQTL's identified in 44 GTEx tissues, along
with the effect size on gene expression (in FPKM), along with the probability the eQTL is in the 95% credible set.

<p>
NOTE: This track is under development, subject to change (and input is welcome!) 
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
Gene/variant pairs occuring in multiple tissues are merged into a single item in the display. 
The item label provides the tissue name or number of tissues.
Mouseover displays effect size and tissues affected by the eQTL.
The item color indicates the greatest effect size noted for the eQTL:
<ul>
<table cellpadding='2'>
<tr><td style='color: fuchsia;'>fuchsia</td><td>high positive</td></tr>
<tr><td style='color: red;'>red</td><td>moderate positive</td></tr>
<tr><td style='color: blue;'>blue</td><td>moderate negative</td></tr>
<tr><td style='color: teal;'>teal</td><td>high negative</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>

<h2>Credits</h2>
Thanks to GTEx investigators and analysts -- particularly Farhad Hormozdiari 
(currently at the Price lab, Harvard), the Eskin lab at UCLA, 
and the GTEx LDACC and portal team for providing this data, and to Christopher Brown (U Penn) 
for input on design of the track.
