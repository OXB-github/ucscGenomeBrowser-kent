<H2> Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows data from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31753849/">
<em>Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals differential nutrient absorption
functions in human intestine</em></a>. In this study, single-cell RNA
sequencing was used to survey gene expression profiles of the epithelium in the
human ileum, colon, and rectum and ultimately the differential expression of
nutrient absorption related genes in these areas.

There are two bar chart tracks in this track collection with colon cells
grouped by either cell type and donor. The default track displayed is colon
cells grouped by cell type.

</P>

<H2>Display Conventions</H2>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.
The coloring algorithm allows cells that show some blended characteristics to show blended
colors so there will be some color variation within a class.

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
Using 10x Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing, RNA profiles of intestinal
epithelial cells were obtained for 4,472 cells from two human colon samples.
The healthy intestine mucosa used was sampled away from the tumor site on
surgically resected tissue belonging to two donors diagnosed with intestinal
tumors. To remove mucus, blood cells, and muscle tissue the intestinal tissues
were washed in cold HBSS buffer.
