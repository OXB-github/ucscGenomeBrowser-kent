<h2> Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows data from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31753849/">
<em>Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals differential nutrient absorption
functions in human intestine</em></a>. Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNA-seq) was used to survey gene expression profiles of the epithelium in
the human ileum, colon, and rectum.  A total of 7 cell clusters were identified
including enterocytes (EC), goblet cells (G), paneth-like cells (PLC),
enteroendocrine cells (EEC), progenitor cells (PRO), transient-amplifying cells
(TA) and stem cells (SC).</p>

<p>
This track collection contains two bar chart tracks of RNA expression in ileum
cells where cells are grouped by cell type (Ileum Cells) or by donor (Ileum Donor). 
The default track displayed is Ileum Cells.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding='2'>
  <thead><tr>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Color</th>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Cell classification</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #0099C0;"></td><td>epithelial</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #0050FF;"></td><td>secretory</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #707070;"></td><td>stem cell</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Cells that fall into multiple classes will be colored by blending the colors associated
with those classes.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
Using scRNA-seq, RNA profiles of intestinal epithelial cells were obtained for
6,167 cells from two human ileum samples. Tissue samples belonged to a male
donor age 60 with Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (Ileum-1) and a female donor age 67
with Adenocarcinoma (Ileum-2). The healthy intestinal mucous membranes used for
each sample were cut away from the tumor border in surgically removed ileum
tissue. Additionally, the intestinal tissues were washed in Hank's balanced
salt solution (HBSS) to remove mucus, blood cells, and muscle tissue. The
sample was enriched for epithelial cells through centrifugation before being
dissociated with Tryple to obtain single-cell  suspensions. RNA-seq libraries
were prepared using 10x Genomics 3' v2 kit and sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq X
Ten PE150.</p>
 

<p>
The cell/gene matrix and cell-level metadata was downloaded from the <a
href="http://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=covid19atlas%2Fc19a-wang20%2Fileum">UCSC Cell Browser</a>.
The UCSC command line tool matrixClusterColumns, matrixToBarChart, and bedToBigBed were used
to transform these into a bar chart format bigBed file that can be visualized. The coloring
was done by defining colors for the broad level cell classes and then using another UCSC tool,
hcaColorCells, to interpolate the colors across all cell types.</p>
