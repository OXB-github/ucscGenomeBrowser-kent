<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track displays the <em>ENCODE Registry of candidate cis-Regulatory Elements</em> (cCREs) in
the human genome, a total of 925,535 elements identified and classified by the 
ENCODE Data Analysis Center according to regulatory effect.
The cCRE dataset is the core of the integrative level of epigenomic and transcriptomic
annotations produced by ENCODE.
</p>
Additional exploration of the cCRE's and underlying raw ENCODE data is provided by the
<a target="_blank" href="https://screen.wenglab.org/">SCREEN web tool</a> 
designed specifically for the registry, accessible by linkouts from the track details page.

<!--
<p>
The related cCREs by Biosample composite track presents ccREs 
and associated epigenetic signal in all individual biosamples in a large matrix.
Additional views of the data are provided by the <a>ENCODE Integrative Megahub</a>.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<!--
1. cCREs with promoter-like signatures (cCRE-PLS) fall within 200 bp (center to center) of an annotated GENCODE TSS and have high DNase and H3K4me3 signals (evaluated as DNase and H3K4me3 max-Z scores, defined as the maximal DNase or H3K4me3 Z scores across all biosamples with data; see Methods).

2. cCREs with enhancer-like signatures (cCRE-ELS) have high DNase and H3K27ac max-Z scores and must additionally have a low H3K4me3 max-Z score if they are within 200 bp of an annotated TSS. The subset of cCREs-ELS within 2 kb of a TSS is denoted proximal (cCRE-pELS), while the remaining subset is denoted distal (cCRE-dELS).

3. DNase-H3K4me3 cCREs have high H3K4me3 max-Z scores but low H3K27ac max-Z scores and do not fall within 200 bp of a TSS.

4. 
CTCF-only cCREs have high DNase and CTCF max-Z scores and low H3K4me3 and H3K27ac max-Z scores.

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The ENCODE accession numbers of the constituent datasets at the
<a target="_blank" href="https://encodeproject.org">ENCODE Portal</a>
are available from the cCRE details page.
</p>
<p>
The data in this track can be interactively explored with the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a> or the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. 
The data can be accessed from scripts through our 
<a href="https://api.genome.ucsc.edu">API</a>, the track name is "encodeCcreCombined".

<p>
For automated download and analysis, this annotation is stored in a bigBed file that
can be downloaded from
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/bbi/" target="_blank">our download server</a>.
The file for this track is called <tt>encodeCcreCombined.bb</tt>. 
Individual regions or the whole genome annotation can be obtained using our tool 
<tt>bigBedToBed</tt> which can be compiled from the source code or downloaded as a precompiled
binary for your system. 
Instructions for downloading source code and binaries can be found
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">here</a>.
The tool can also be used to obtain only features within a given range, e.g. 
<tt>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/hg19/bbi/encodeCcreCombined.bb -chrom=chr21 -start=0 -end=100000000 stdout</tt></p>
