<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track displays all human Candidate Cis-Regulatory Elements (cCREs), 
identified and classified by ENCODE Data Analysis Center according to 
regulatory effect (promoter-like, enhancer-like, CTCF-bound).</p>
<p>
The related cCREs by Biosample composite track presents ccREs 
and associated epigenetic signal in all individual biosamples in a large matrix.
Additional views of the data are provided by the <a>ENCODE Integrative Megahub</a>.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
CCres are colored according to their 
classification (red for promoter-like, orange for proximal enhancer-like, 
yellow for distal enhancer-like, and blue for CTCF-bound). 
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
