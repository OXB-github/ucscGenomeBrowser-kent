<P>
Agilent's oligonucleotide CGH (Comparative Genomic Hybridization) platform enables the
study of genome-wide DNA copy number changes at a high resolution. The CGH probes on Agilent
aCGH microarrays are 60-mer oligonucleotides synthesized in situ using Agilent's inkjet
SurePrint technology. The probes represented on the Agilent CGH microarrays have been
selected using algorithms developed specifically for the CGH application, assuring optimal
performance of these probes in detecting DNA copy number changes.
