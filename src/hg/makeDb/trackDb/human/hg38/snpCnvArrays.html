<h2>Agilent Arrays</h2>
<p>
The arrays listed in this track are probes from the
<a href="https://www.genomics.agilent.com/article.jsp?pageId=75"
target="_blank">Agilent Catalog Oligonucleotide Microarrays</a>.
</P>
<p>Please note than the many more microarray tracks are available on the hg19 genome assembly
than are here on the hg38 assembly. To view those tracks, please 
<a href="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=genotypeArrays">click this link for hg19 microarrays</a>.
Microarrays that are not listed can be added as Custom Tracks with data from the companies.

<P>
Agilent's oligonucleotide CGH (Comparative Genomic Hybridization) platform enables the
study of genome-wide DNA copy number changes at a high resolution. The CGH probes on Agilent
CGH microarrays are 60-mer oligonucleotides synthesized in situ using Agilent's inkjet
SurePrint technology. The probes represented on the Agilent CGH microarrays have been
selected using algorithms developed specifically for the CGH application, assuring optimal
performance of these probes in detecting DNA copy number changes.
