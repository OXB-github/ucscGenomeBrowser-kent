<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track displays data from <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32624006/"><em>A reference single-cell
transcriptomic atlas of human skeletal muscle tissue reveals bifurcated muscle
stem cell populations</em></a>. Muscle tissue was analyzed using single-cell
RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and subsequent clustering distinguished 16
muscle-resident cell types based on their identified marker genes found in De
Micheli <em>et al</em>., 2020. Muscle samples were from surgically discarded
tissue taken from a wide variety of anatomical sites.</p>

<p> 
There are two bar chart tracks in this track collection with muscle RNA from
all cells of a given type grouped by either cell type or biosample.</p>

<!--#insert file="$track.insert.html"-->

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>

<p>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding='2'>
  <thead><tr>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Color</th>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Cell classification</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #707070;"></td><td>stem cell</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #FF8838;"></td><td>adipose</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #B05020;"></td><td>fibroblast</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #F01111;"></td><td>immune</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #C000C0;"></td><td>muscle</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #00C000;"></td><td>endothelial</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p> 
Cells that fall into multiple classes will be colored by blending the colors associated
with those classes.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
Muscle samples were taken from 10 healthy donors of ages ranging from 41-81
years old from different sections of the face (F), trunk (T), and leg (L). Using 10x
Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing was used to generate over 22,000 RNA
transcriptomic profiles from all of the samples. The single cell transcriptomes
from the 10 datasets were integrated using a scRNA-seq integration method
called Scanorama as described in the reference below.</p>

<p>
The cell/gene matrix and cell-level metadata was downloaded from the <a
href="http://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=muscle-cell-atlas">UCSC Cell Browser</a>. The
UCSC command line tool matrixClusterColumns, matrixToBarChart, and bedToBigBed
were used to transform these into a bar chart format bigBed file that can be
visualized. The coloring was done by defining colors for the broad level cell
classes and then using another UCSC tool, hcaColorCells, to interpolate the
colors across all cell types.</p>
