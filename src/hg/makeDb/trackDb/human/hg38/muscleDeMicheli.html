<H2> Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays data from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32624006/"><em>A reference single-cell transcriptomic atlas of human skeletal muscle tissue reveals bifurcated muscle stem cell populations</em></a>. Muscle tissue was analyzed using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and subsequent clustering distinguished 16 muscle-resident cell types based on their identified marker genes found in De Micheli <em>et al</em>., 2020. Muscle samples were from surgically discarded tissue taken from a wide variety of anatomical sites. 
</P>

<P> 
There are two bar chart tracks in this track collection with muscle RNA from all cells of a given type grouped by either cell type or biosample. The primary track displayed is muscle RNA grouped by cell type. 
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions</H2>

<P>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.
The coloring algorithm allows cells that show some blended characteristics to show blended
colors so there will be some color variation within a class.

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>

Muscle samples were taken from 10 healthy donors of ages ranging from 41-81 years old from different sections of the face, torso, and leg. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to generate over 22,000 RNA transcriptomic profiles from all of the samples. The single cell transcriptomes from the 10 datasets were integrated using a scRNA-seq integration method called Scanorama as described in the reference below.
