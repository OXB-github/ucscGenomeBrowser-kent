<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track displays data from <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30429548/"
target="_blank"><em>Single-cell reconstruction of the early maternal-fetal
interface in humans</em></a>. Using droplet-based 10x and plate-based
Smart-seq2 single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) ~70,000 cells were profiled
from first-trimester placentas with matched decidual cells and maternal PBMCs.</p>

<p>
This track collection contains six bar chart tracks of RNA expression in the
human placenta, decidua, and maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) where cells are grouped by cell type (Placenta Cells, Placenta Cells
Ss2), detailed cell type (Placenta Detail, Placenta Detail Ss2), cell location
(Placenta Loc, Placenta Loc Ss2), stage (Placenta Stage), and placenta and
decidua cells (Placenta Mat/Fet, Placenta Mat/Fet Ss2). The default tracks
displayed are Placenta Cells, Placenta Loc, and Placenta Loc Ss2.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding='2'>
  <thead><tr>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Color</th>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Cell classification</th>

  <tr><td style="background-color: #B05020;"></td><td>fibroblast</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #F01111;"></td><td>immune</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #C000C0;"></td><td>muscle</td></tr>

  <tr><td style="background-color: #0099C0;"></td><td>epithelial</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #00C000;"></td><td>endothelial</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Cells that fall into multiple classes will be colored by blending the colors associated
with those classes. The colors will be purest in the Placenta Cells and Placenta Cells Ss2 
subtracks, where the bars represent relatively pure cell types. They can give an overview of 
the cell composition within other categories in other subtracks as well.</p>


<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
Tissue was collected from 5 placentas (6-14 gestational weeks) and 11 deciduas.
Additionally, blood was drawn from 6 of the donors (D4-D9) and enriched for
PBMCs using a Ficoll-Paque gradient. Decidual and placental tissue were both
first macroscopically separated. Decidual tissue was then chopped before
enzymatic dissociation. Placental villi was scraped from the chorionic membrane
before enzymatic dissociation. Decidual and blood cells were enriched for
certain populations using an antibody panel prior to Smart-seq2 library
prepartion. Cells from blood decidua and placenta were enriched using FACS
prior to 10x Genomics v2 library preparation. Smart-seq2 libraries were
sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000. 10x libaries were sequenced on an Illumina
HiSeq4000.</p>

<p>
The cell/gene matrix and cell-level metadata was downloaded from the <a
href="http://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=placenta-decidua" target="_blank">UCSC Cell Browser</a>.
The UCSC command line tool matrixClusterColumns, matrixToBarChart, and bedToBigBed
were used to transform these into a bar chart format bigBed file that can be
visualized. The coloring was done by defining colors for the broad level cell
classes and then using another UCSC tool, hcaColorCells, to interpolate the
colors across all cell types. The UCSC tools can be found on our download
server: <a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads"
