<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.
The coloring algorithm allows cells that show some blended characteristics to show blended
colors so there will be some color variation within a class. The colors will be purest in
the <a href="hgTrackUi?g=fetalGeneAtlasCellType">Fetal Cells</a> subtrack, where the bars 
represent relatively pure cell types. They can give an overview of the cell composition 
within other categories in other subtracks as well.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
<em>et al</em>.
</p>
<p>

The cell/gene matrix and cell-level metadata was downloaded from the <a
href="http://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=fetal-gene-atlas+all" target="_blank">
UCSC Cell Browser</a>. The UCSC command line utility matrixClusterColumns,
matrixToBarChart, and bedToBigBed were used to transform these into a bar chart
format bigBed file that can be visualized. The coloring was done by defining
colors for the broad level cell classes and then using another UCSC utility,
hcaColorCells, to interpolate the colors across all cell types.
The UCSC utilities can be found on 
<a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads"

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw <a href="/goldenPath/help/barChart.html">bar chart</a> data can be
explored interactively with the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table
Browser</a>, or the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. For
automated analysis, the data may be queried from our <a
href="/goldenPath/help/api.html">REST API</a>. Please refer to our <a
href="https://groups.google.com/a/soe.ucsc.edu/forum/#!forum/genome">mailing
list archives</a> for questions, or our <a
href="../FAQ/FAQdownloads.html#download36">Data Access FAQ</a> for more
information.</p>

<p>Thanks to the many authors who worked on producing and publishing this data set.  
The data were integrated into the UCSC Genome Browser by Jim Kent and Brittney Wick 
then reviewed by Jairo Navarro. The UCSC work was paid for by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.</p>
