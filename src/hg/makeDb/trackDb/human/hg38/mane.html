<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The RefSeq project at the NCBI and the Ensembl/GENCODE project at EMBL-EBI have
provided independent high-quality human reference gene datasets to biologists
since the sequencing of the human genome. Now we are joining together on an
exciting new project we are calling Matched Annotation from the NCBI and
EMBL-EBI or MANE, to provide a matched set of well-supported transcripts for
human protein-coding genes and define one representative transcript for each
gene. Both RefSeq and Ensembl will continue to provide a rich set of alternate
transcripts per gene.
<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables"
target="_blank">Table Browser</a>, or the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator"
target="_blank">Data Integrator</a>. For automated analysis, genome annotation is stored in a bigGenePred file that can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/mane/" target="_blank">download
server</a>. Individual regions or the whole genome annotation can be obtained using our tool
<em>bigBedToBed</em> which can be compiled from the source code or
downloaded as a precompiled binary for your system. Instructions for downloading source code and
binaries can be found <a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/" target="_blank">here</a>.
The tool can also be used to obtain only features within a given range, for example:</p> 
<tt>bigBedToBed -chrom=chr6 -start=0 -end=1000000 http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/mane/mane.0.5.bb stdout</tt>
