The RefSeq project at the NCBI and the Ensembl/GENCODE project at EMBL-EBI have
provided independent high-quality human reference gene datasets to biologists
since the sequencing of the human genome. Now we are joining together on an
exciting new project we are calling Matched Annotation from the NCBI and
EMBL-EBI or MANE, to provide a matched set of well-supported transcripts for
human protein-coding genes and define one representative transcript for each
gene. Both RefSeq and Ensembl will continue to provide a rich set of alternate
transcripts per gene.
