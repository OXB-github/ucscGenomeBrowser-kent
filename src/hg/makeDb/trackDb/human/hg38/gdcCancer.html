<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows the genomic positions of variants found in the
<a href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov" target="_blank">Genomic Data Commons Cancer Database</a> gathered from
a set of thirty-three data sets collect by the TCGA project.

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<H2>Data access</H2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a>
or the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>.

<p>
For automated download and analysis, the genome annotation is stored in a bigBed file that
can be downloaded from
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/hg38/gdcCancer.bb" target="_blank">our download server</a>.
The file for this track is called <tt>gdcCancer.bb</tt> . Individual
regions or the whole genome annotation can be obtained using our tool <tt>bigBedToBed</tt>
which can be compiled from the source code or downloaded as a precompiled
binary for your system. Instructions for downloading source code and binaries can be found
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">here</a>.
The tool
can also be used to obtain only features within a given range, e.g. 
<tt>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/hg38/gdcCancer.bb -chrom=chr21 -start=0 -end=100000000 stdout</tt></p>
</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
GDC files were reformatted at UCSC to the <a href="../goldenPath/help/bigBed.html">bigBed</a> format.
The data is updated every month, one week after the ClinVar release date.
The program that performs the update is available on
<a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/utils/cancerMafToBigBed"
target="_blank">Github</a>.
