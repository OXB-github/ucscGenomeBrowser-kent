<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The
<a target="_blank" href="https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/#!">Genomics England PanelApp</a>
tracks show virtual gene panels related to human disorders. Originally developed to
aid interpretation of participant genomes in the 100,000 Genomes Project, PanelApp
is now also being used as the platform for achieving consensus on gene panels in the
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/genomics/nhs-genomic-med-service/">
NHS Genomic Medicine Service (GMS)</a>.
As panels in PanelApp are publicly available, they can also be used by other groups
and projects. Panels are maintained and updated by
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/">Genomics England</a> curators.
<p>
Genes and genomic entities (short tandem repeats/STRs and copy number variants/CNVs)
have been reviewed by experts to enable a community consensus to be reached on which
genes and genomic entities should appear on a <b>diagnostics grade panel</b> for each disorder.
A <b>rating system</b> (confidence level 0 - 3) is used to classify the level of evidence
supporting association with phenotypes covered by the gene panel in question.

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
The individual tracks are colored by <b>confidence level:</b>

<ul>
<li><b><font color="#32CD32">Score 3 (lime green)</font></b> - <b>High level of evidence</b> 
for this gene-disease association. Demonstrates confidence that this gene should be 
used for genome interpretation.</li>
<li><b><font color="#FFBF00">Score 2 (amber)</font></b> - <b>Moderate evidence</b> 
for this gene-disease association. This gene should not be used for genomic 
interpretation.</li>
<li><b><font color="red">Score 0 or 1 (red)</font></b> - <b>Not enough evidence</b> 
for this gene-disease association. This gene should not be used for 
genomic interpretation. </li>
<br>
Mouseover on items shows the gene name, confidence level, mode of inheritance 
(if known) and phenotypes related to the gene. supporting evidence of 
dosage sensitivity. Tracks can be filtered according to the confidence 
level of disease association evidence. For more information on

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
PanelApp files were reformatted at UCSC to the <a target="_blank"
