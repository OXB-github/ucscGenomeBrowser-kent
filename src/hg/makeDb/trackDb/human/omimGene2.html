<H2>Description</H2>

<!--#insert file="omimDescriptionText.html"-->

<P>
This track shows the genomic positions of all <B>gene entries</B> in the Online Mendelian
Inheritance in Man (<A HREF="https://www.omim.org/" TARGET=_blank>OMIM</A>) database.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>Genomic locations of OMIM gene entries are displayed as solid blocks.  The entries are colored
according to the associated <b>OMIM phenotype map key</b> (if any):
<UL>
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#AAC4AA">Lighter Green</FONT></B> for phenotype map key 1 OMIM records
-  the disorder has been placed on the map based on its association with
a gene, but the underlying defect is not known.
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#669666">Light Green</FONT></B> for phenotype map key 2 OMIM records
- the disorder has been placed on the map by linkage; no mutation has
been found.
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#005000">Dark Green</FONT></B> for phenotype map key 3 OMIM records
- the molecular basis for the disorder is known; a mutation has been
found in the gene.
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#69329B">Purple</FONT></B> for phenotype map key 4 OMIM records
- a contiguous gene deletion or duplication syndrome; multiple genes
are deleted or duplicated causing the phenotype.
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#BEBEBE">Light Gray</FONT></B> for Others
- no associated OMIM phenotype map key info available.
</UL>
<P><b>Gene symbol</b>, <b>phenotype</b>, and <b>inheritance</b> information, when available, are 
displayed on the details page for an item, and links to related RefSeq Genes and UCSC Genes are 
given. The descriptions of the OMIM entries are shown on the main browser display when mousing over
each entry.

<P>
<b>Brackets, "[ ]"</b>, before the phenotype name indicate "nondiseases," mainly genetic variations that
lead to apparently abnormal laboratory test values (e.g., dysalbuminemic euthyroidal 
hyperthyroxinemia).
</P>
<P>
<b>Braces, "{ }"</b>, indicate mutations that contribute to susceptibility to multifactorial disorders
(e.g., diabetes, asthma) or to susceptibility to infection (e.g., malaria).
</P>
<P>
A <b>question mark, "?"</b>, indicates that the relationship between the phenotype and gene is provisional.
More details about this relationship are provided in the comment field of the map and in the gene
and phenotype OMIM entries.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The mappings displayed in this track are based on OMIM gene entries, their Entrez Gene IDs, and
the corresponding RefSeq Gene locations:
<UL>
<LI>The data file <TT>genemap.txt</TT> from OMIM was loaded into the MySQL table <TT>omimGeneMap</TT>.
<LI>The data file <TT>mim2gene.txt</TT> from OMIM was processed and loaded into the MySQL table <TT>omim2gene</TT>.
<LI>Entries in <TT>genemap.txt</TT> having disorder info were parsed and loaded into the 
<TT>omimPhenotype</TT> table.
<LI>For each OMIM gene in the <TT>omim2gene</TT> table, the
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene" TARGET=_blank>Entrez Gene ID</A> was used to get the
corresponding <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/" target="_blank">RefSeq Gene ID</a> via
the <TT>refLink</TT> table, and the RefSeq ID was used to get the genomic location from the
<TT>refGene</TT> table.* The OMIM gene IDs and corresponding RefSeq Gene locations were loaded into
the <TT>omimGene2</tt> table, the primary table for this track.
</P>
</UL>
<P>
*The locations in the <TT>refGene</TT> table are from alignments of RefSeq Genes to the reference
genome using BLAT.
</P>
