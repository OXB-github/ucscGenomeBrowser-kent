<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track set shows <b>GWAS meta-analyses</b> from the 
<a target=_blank href="https://www.covid19hg.org/">
<b>COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI)</b></a>, 
a collaborative project bringing together the human genetics community to facilitate 
the generation, analysis and sharing of COVID-19 host genetics research.
The COVID-19 HGI organizes meta-analyses across multiple studies contributed by 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.covid19hg.org/partners/">partners world-wide</a>
to learn the genetic determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility, disease severity and 
outcomes, and provides a platform to share the results from such activities, as well as 
the individual-level data where possible.
</p>
<p>
The specific phenotypes studied by the COVID-19 HGI are those that benefit
from maximal sample size. The primary analysis focuses on disease severity.
Two meta-analyses are represented in this track:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>ANA_C2_V2</b>: covid vs. population (6696 cases from 18 studies)</li>
<li><b>ANA_B2_V2</b>: hospitalized covid vs. population (3199 cases from 8 studies)</li>
</ul>

<H2>Display Conventions</H2>
<p>
Displayed items are colored by <b>GWAS effect</b>:  red for positive, blue for negative. 
The height of the item reflects the <b>effect size</b> (log OR scale).
The color saturation indicates <b>statistical significance</b>: greater than .05 pValue are 
brightly colored (bright red
<span style='background-color: #ff0000;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
, bright blue
<span style='background-color: #0000ff;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
),
those with less significance are paler (light red
<span style='background-color: #ffa0a0;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
, light blue
<span style='background-color: #a0a0ff;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
).
</p>

<p>
Each track has separate display controls and data can be filtered according to the
<b>number of studies</b>, <b>minimum -log10 p-value</b>, and the 
<b>effect size on log(OR) scale</b>, using the track <b>Configure</b> options.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mouseover</b> on items shows the rs ID (or chrom:pos if none assigned), both the non-effect 
and effect alleles, 
the effect size on log(OR) scale, the -log10 p-value, and the number of studies.
Additional information on each variant can be found on the details page by clicking on the item.
</p>  

<H2>Methods</H2>
<p>
Data were generated from genome wide SNP arrays, exome and genome sequencing, leveraging the impact 
of both common and rare variants. Statistical analysis takes into account differences between 
sex, ancestry, and date of sample collection. More information about the prospective studies, 
processing pipeline, results and data sharing can be found
