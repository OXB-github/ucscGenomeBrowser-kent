<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov" target=_blank>Nextstrain.org</a> displays
data about protein-coding variants that occur in the current 2019/2020 outbreak. 
Since next-strain shows only protein coding variants but this Genome Browser shows
the whole genome, we have added a genome track to show which part of the genome 
is covered by Nextstrain.
</p>

<p>
Use this track in conjunction with the tracks 
    Nextstrain Vars</em> (all variants) and <em>Nextstrain Clades</em> (the main classes
of variants as defined by Nextstrain).

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data was downloaded from Nextstrain, file ncov.json.</p>
