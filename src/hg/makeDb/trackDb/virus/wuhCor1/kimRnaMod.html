<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
Very small tickmarks indicate the position of the RNA modifications on the
genome. One has to zoom in to basepair level detail to see their exact extent. A
small barchart over the tick indicates the fraction of transcripts that are modified
relative to the un-modified transcripts. E.g. frac=0.3 means that 30% of the transcripts
were modified. There is one barchart per transcript.
