<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
We identified potential targets for immune responses to 2019-nCoV
and provide essential information for understanding human immune responses
to this virus and evaluation of diagnostic and vaccine candidates.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Effective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion
of the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) require the development of data
and tools to understand and monitor viral spread and immune responses.
However, little information about the targets of immune responses to
2019-nCoV is available. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis
Resource (IEDB) resource to catalog available data related to other
coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to
2019-nCoV, and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope
responses. We identified multiple specific regions in 2019-nCoV that have
high homology to SARS virus. Parallel bionformatic predictions identified a
priori potential B and T cell epitopes for 2019-nCoV. The independent
identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high
probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019-nCoV.
