<H2>Description</H2>
This track shows deletions that have been found in the sequences uploaded to the GISAID database. Three confidence levels of deletion calls are shown: <span style="color: rgb(170,170,170)"><b>deletions found in at least 1 GISAID sequence</b></span> , <span style="color: rgb(85,85,85)"><b>deletions found in at least 2 GISAID sequences</b></span>, and <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0)"><b>deletions found in at least 2 GISAID sequences that were able to be validated with raw reads.</b></span>
<P>


<H2>Methods</H2>
    We accessed all GISAID SARS-CoV-2 sequences on May 7, 2020. We filtered to high coverage reads encompassing the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome (>=29000 bps), leaving 12,403 sequences. We aligned the reads using MAFFT.
<P>


<H2>Verification</H2>
    We validated several deletions with the raw reads from NCBI's SRA Run browser. Additionally, NYU Langone Health provided us with the aligned reads for many of their sequences.

<H2>Credits</H2>
We thank all of the labs that submitted their sequences to the GISAID database. The full acknowledgement table can be found at <A HREF="https://github.com/briannachrisman/SARS-CoV-2_Microdeletions/blob/master/acknowledgments.pdf" TARGET=ucscSchema title='Open table schema in new window'>https://github.com/briannachrisman/SARS-CoV-2_Microdeletions/blob/master/acknowledgments.pdf</A>.  We thank the public health laboratories VIDRL and MDU-PHL at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity for providing over 1000 high quality raw reads to NCBI. Thank you NYU Langone SARS-CoV2 Sequencing Team's Matthew T Maurano, Matija Snuderl, and Adriana Heguy for providing many of their raw reads.
