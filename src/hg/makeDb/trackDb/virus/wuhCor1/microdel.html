<H2>Description</H2>
<p>This track shows deletions that have been found in the sequences uploaded to the GISAID database.
Three confidence levels of deletion calls are shown: </p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgb(170,170,170)"><b>deletions found in at least 1 
GISAID sequence</b></span></li>
<li> <span style="color: rgb(85,85,85)"><b>deletions found in at least 2 GISAID
sequences</b></span></li>
<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0)"><b>deletions found in at least 2 GISAID sequences that
were able to be validated with raw reads.</b></span></li></ul>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<p>
We accessed all GISAID SARS-CoV-2 sequences on May 7, 2020. We filtered to high coverage 
reads encompassing the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome (&gt;=29000 bps), leaving 12,403 sequences.
We aligned the reads using MAFFT.</p>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<p>We validated several deletions with the raw reads from NCBI's SRA Run browser. 
Additionally, NYU Langone Health provided us with the aligned reads for many of 
their sequences.</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="hgTables">Table Browser</a>, combined with other datasets in the
<a href="hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a> tool, 
or downloaded directly as &quot;microdel.txt.gz&quot; from
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/wuhCor1/database">the download server</a>.
Please refer to our
