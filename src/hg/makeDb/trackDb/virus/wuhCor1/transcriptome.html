<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
<p>This track shows predicted and experimental representations of the
SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome based on long-read Nanopore sequencing.<p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 generates sub-genomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) for all ORFs. The virus
achieves this by recombination mechanisms in which replication machinery
jumps from one of many TRS-B site(transcription regulatory sequence, body) to
the TRS-L (leader sequence) during negative strand synthesis.
These negative strands are then used as templates for mRNA synthesis. 
</p>

<p>On these tracks we depict the predicted mRNAs with the excised sequence
drawn like introns. The ORFs predicted to be translated by these mRNAs are
shown in thick boxes.  The thin bars function as UTRs for that particular mRNA
species.<p>

<p>Multiple subtracks are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>TRS sites</b>: Annotated core TRS sequence (ACGAAC) in the viral genome
that allows recombination. One site TRS* differs from the canonical TRS site by
1 nt, but has experimental support and is required to generate a 7b mRNA.
<li><b>SARS-CoV-2 Transcripts</b>: Canonical SARS-CoV-2 Transcripts (gRNA and
mRNA). Generated by recombining all TRS-B sites in the above track with the
leader.  Note the actual recombination breakpoints can often be drawn in
multiple ways (since the TRS core motif is identical), and direct RNA
sequencing suggests slightly different breakpoints, depending on the mRNA.  
See the experimental tracks if your analysis requires a detailed understanding of the breaks. The reported breaks in this track are only meant to be approximate. 
<li><b>Kim Recombined transcripts</b>: All RNA recombination products reported by Nanopore direct RNA sequencing in Kim et al, 2020, Cell.
<li><b>Kim Recomb. TRS transcripts</b>: RNA recombination products that involve the leader on the 5' end; validated by nanopore sequencing. The score is the number of reads divided by 100. RNAs with read support >100,000 are rounded to a score of 1000.
<li><b>Kim Recomb. Novel transcripts</b>: RNA recombination products that do NOT involve the leader, discovered by nanopore sequencing. RNAs with less than 100 reads were discarded. The score is the number of reads. RNAs with read support >1000 are listed as 1000.
</ul>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<ul>
<li>TRS sites: The core TRS sequence (ACGAAC) was identified using the findMotif tool.  The TRS* (AaGAAC) site identified in Kim et al was manually added to create overall agreement with their Figure 1.
<li>SARS CoV-2 Transcripts: Using the TRS track, we generated mRNAs which span from nt 1-75 (the end of the TRS-L core sequence) and resume at the 3' end of all TRS-B sequences.  Neither the 5' and 3' terminal ends of these RNAs, nor their internal breakpoints, should be considered exact.  CDS sequences match Figure 1 from Kim et al. 
<li>Kim Recombined transcripts: was generated from Table S2 of Kim et al, 2020. This represents all RNA species identified by direct RNA sequencing. Scores are the number of reads divided by 100 (RNAs with >1000 reads are rounded to 1000).
<li>Kim Recomb. TRS transcripts: generated from Table S3 of Kim et al, 2020.  These viral transcripts all contain the TRS-L recombined with 3' viral sequence.
<li>Kim Recomb. Novel transcripts: this track was generated from Table S4. These viral transcripts contain novel recombination events that do NOT involve the leader.
</ul>
