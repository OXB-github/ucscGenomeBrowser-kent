<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The NCBI Gene track for the 13 Jan 2020
  <em>SARS-CoV-2 virus</em>/GCF_009858895.2_ASM985889v3 genome assembly is
constructed from the gff file <b>GCF_009858895.2_ASM985889v3_genomic.gff.gz</b> delivered with the
NCBI RefSeq genome assemblies at the FTP location:<br>

<h2>Track statistics summary</h2>
<p>
<b>Total genome size: </b>29,903</br>
<b>Gene count: </b>11<br>
<b>Bases in genes: </b>29,132</br>
<b>Percent genome coverage: </b>&percnt; 97.422</br>
</p>
<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the 
<a href="hgTables">Table Browser</a>, or the 
<a href="hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. 
For automated analysis, the genome annotation is stored in 
a bigBed file that can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/">the download server</a>. 

Annotations can
be converted to ASCII text by our tool bigBedToBed which can be compiled from 
the source code or downloaded as a precompiled binary for your system. 
Instructions for downloading source code and binaries can be 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">found here</a>. 
The tool can also be used to obtain features within a given range, 
for example:
</p>
<code>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/ncbiGene.bb -chrom=NC_045512v2 -start=0 -end=29902 stdout</code>
