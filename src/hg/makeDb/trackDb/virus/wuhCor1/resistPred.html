<h2>Description</h2> 
<p> This track lists locations with amino acid positions that are close to 
Covid drugs, so potentially relevant for resistance. The data is derived 
from PDB structures and was imported from <a target=_blank href="https://coronavirus3d.org/#/drug">
    Coronavirus3d.org</a>, a project funded by NIAID, NIGMS and UCR.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
Locations of amino acids within 5 Angstrom are highlighted. The label of the annotations is the number of GISAID sequences with at least on mutation
at this position. Click or mouse over 
the mutations to show the full description. You can see the original data 
as tables on <a target=_blank href="https://coronavirus3d.org/#/drug">Coronavirus3d.org</a>.
 
<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="hgTables">Table Browser</a> or the
<a href="hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>.
For automated analysis, the genome annotation is stored in
a bigBed file that can be downloaded from
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/">the download server</a>
or the <a href="../../goldenPath/help/api.html">API</a>.
