<H2>Description</H2>
<p>This track shows iSNP's (intrahost SNP's).  These are SNPs that have
evidence for variation within one host. For instance, one patient can have
variation in the viral sequences within their cells. This variation is lost
when a single consensus genome sequence is reported for a patient.  The data
was published in Sapoval et al, 2020 <a target=_blank href =
"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.184481v1">"Hidden genomic
diversity of SARS-CoV-2: implications for qRT-PCR diagnostics and
transmission"</a> <p>In this track, iSNP's (intrahost SNP's) of human patients
from New York City and Houston are shown.</p>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<p>The track contains list of iSNP's found in patient data from New York City and Houston with base and amino acid changes. One feature per variant. The name field in this track represents the median observed allele frequency for patients meeting inclusion criteria in the VCFâ€™s provided by Sapoval et al. Finally, bedToBigBed was used to create the BigBed track.</a>
<p>Interested users may wish to inspect each of the individual VCFs; for this track we have chosen to show a condensed version of all VCFs (see Methods). 

<H2>Methods</H2>

<p>VCF files were downloaded from the Rice University data repository. SARS-CoV-2 iSNP's from New York City and Houston patient data were parsed, and if the base position was modified in more than one sample then it was included. The frequency of observing a particular base (A,C,G,T) at the position when a change was recorded was then included, and the dominant base change was used to determine whether the base modification would also result in an amino acid change. </a>
