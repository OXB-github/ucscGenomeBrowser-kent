<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
<p>This track shows data from  Braun et al, 2020,<a target=_blank href = "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20061440v1.full.pdf+html">"Presence of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in COVID-19 patients and healthy donors"</a>
<p>The authors stimulated PBMCs with two sets (M1 and M2) of overlapping SARS-CoV peptide pools.  
Importantly these are SARS-Cov peptides that have experimental support as putative MHC-II epitopes for SARS-CoV, but note they do not all 100% match SARS-Cov-2 sequence.
Using these peptide sets, the authors "demonstrate the presence of S-reactive CD4+ 52 T cells in 83% of COVID-19 patients, 53 as well as in 34% of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy donors (HD), albeit at lower frequencies."

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p> 
Two tracks are available:
</p>
<ul>
<li>M1_peptides: The more N-terminal peptide library
<li>M2 peptides: The more C-terminal peptide library
</ul>

<p> The annotated interval represents the alignment of the peptide to the viral
genome.  The sequence displayed in the name is SARS-CoV peptide sequence (which
is the actual sequence which was used in the paper, but not necessarily
identical to the SARS-CoV-2 peptide).</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Table S1 contains the peptide sequences (SARS-CoV sequence) used.  This table was downloaded and tblastn was used to align the identified the SARS-CoV peptides to the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
<p>A small number of peptides were not found or reported erroneous hits, in which the coordinates were identified by manually blat-ing the SARS-CoV-2 sequence from the alignments reported in Fig S1.
