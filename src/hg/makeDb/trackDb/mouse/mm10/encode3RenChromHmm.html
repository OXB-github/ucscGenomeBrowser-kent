<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The ENCODE project has established an epigenomic resource for mammalian development,
profiling a diverse panel of mouse tissues at eight developmental stages from 10.5 days post
conception until birth. 
This track set presents chromatin state annotations derived from ChIP-seq 
of histone modifications performed by the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://renlab.sdsc.edu/renlab_website//">Bing Ren Lab</a> 
as part of the ENCODE phase 3 project.</p>
<p>
The chromHMM method was used to integrate ChIP-seq data from 8 histone 
modifications (H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, H3K4me2, H3K4me1, H3K9me3, H3K9ac, H3K36me3). 
In total, fifteen chromatin states were used to segment the genome, and these states 
were then grouped and colored to highlight predicted functional elements.</p>
<p>

<h2> Display Conventions and Configuration </h2>
<p>
This track is a composite track that contains multiple subtracks. Each subtrack represents data 
for a different tissue and age, and displays individually on the browser. 
</p>
<p>
The fifteen states of the HMM, their associated segment color, and the candidate annotations 
are as follows:

<ul>
<li>State 1 - <span style="background-color: darkgreen">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                Dark Green - Promoter, Active (Pr-A)

</ul>

<h2>Methods</h2>

To leverage chromatin state information captured by patterns of histone 
modifications, ChromHMM analysis was applied to ChIP-seq data from 8 histone modifications, 
producing a 15-state model that shows high consistency between biological replicates 
and general agreement with previously published models.
The states were then used to segment the genome in each tissue and stage. 
</p>
<p>
Each state was assigned a descriptive label based on its genomic distribution 
and similarity to known chromatin signatures.
The resulting chromatin states fall into 4 broad functional classes: 
<em>promoter</em>, <em>enhancer</em>, <em>transcriptional</em>, and <em>heterochromatic</em>.</p>
<p>
This track set represents pooled chromatin state calls, 
in which ChIP-seq for two biological replicates was pooled prior to 
chromatin state segmentation. 
<p>

Histone ChIP-seq experiments in this track were performed by the Ren Lab
(UC San Diego/Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research) as part of the ENCODE Consortium (phase 3). 
The raw data were processed by uniform pipelines provided by the ENCODE Analysis and Data 
Coordination centers. The chromHMM annotations were generated by Dr. Iros Barozzi and 
colleagues in the
