<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The ENCODE project has established an epigenomic resource for mammalian development,
profiling a diverse panel of mouse tissues at eight developmental stages from 10.5 days post
conception until birth. 
This track set presents chromatin state annotations derived from ChIP-seq of histone modifications 
performed by the Ren lab as part of the ENCODE phase 3 project. 
The chromHMM method was used to integrate ChIP-seq data from 8 histone 
modifications (H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, H3K4me2, H3K4me1, H3K9me3, H3K9ac, H3K36me3). 
In total, fifteen chromatin states were used to segment the genome, and these states 
were then grouped and colored to highlight predicted functional elements.

<h2> Display Conventions and Configuration </h2>
<p>
This track is a composite track that contains multiple subtracks. Each subtrack represents data 
for a different cell type and displays individually on the browser. 
Instructions for configuring tracks with multiple subtracks are here. 
The fifteen states of the HMM, their associated segment color, and the candidate annotations 
are as follows:

<ul>
<li>State 1 - Dark Green - Promoter, Active (Pr-A) 
<li> State 2 - Light Green - Promoter, Weak (Pr-W) 
<li> State 3 - Light Grey - Promoter, Bivalent (Pr-B) 
<li> State 4 - Green - Promoter, Flanking Region (Pr-F)
<li> State 5 - Bright Yellow - Enhancer, Strong TSS-distal (En-Sd)  
<li> State 6 - Bright Yellow - Enhancer, Strong TSS-proximal (En-Sp)   
<li> State 7 - Light Yellow - Enhancer, Weak (En-W)
<li> State 8 - Dark Grey - Enhancer, Poised TSS-distal (En-Pd)  
<li> State 9 - Dark Grey - Enhancer, Poised TSS-proximal (En-Pp)  
<li> State 10 - Dark Blue - Transcription, Strong (Tr-S)
<li> State 11 - Royal Blue - Transcription, Permissive (Tr-P)
<li> State 12 - Light Blue - Transcription, Initiation (Tr-I)
<li> State 13 - Salmon  - Heterochromatin, Polycomb-associated (Hc-P)
<li> State 14 -  Pink  - Heterochromatin, H3K9me3-associated (Hc-H)
<li> State 15 - White - No significant signal (Ns)
</ul>

<h2>Methods</h2>

To leverage the chromatin state information captured by combinatorial patterns of histone 
modifications we applied ChromHMM to ChIP-seq data from 8 histone modifications, deriving 
a 15-state model that shows near-perfect consistency between biological replicates and general 
agreement with previously published models. Each state was assigned a descriptive label based 
on its genomic distribution and similarity to known chromatin signatures. 
The resulting chromatin states into 4 broad functional classes: promoter states, enhancer states, 
transcriptional states, and heterochromatic states. The states were then used to segment the 
genome in each tissue and stage. This track sets represents pooled chromatin state calls, 
in which ChIP-seq for two biological replicates was pooled prior to chromatin state segmentation. 

<h2>Data Access</h2>

<p>Histone ChIP-seq experiments in this track were performed by the Ren Lab 
(UC San Diego/Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research) as part of the ENCODE Consortium (phase 3). 
The raw data were processed by uniform pipelines provided by the ENCODE Analysis and Data 
Coordination centers. The chromHMM annotations were generated by Dr. Iros Barozzi and 
colleagues in the Environmental Genomics and Systems Biology Division at the Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory.</p>
