<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The ENCODE project has established an epigenomic resource for mammalian development,
profiling a diverse panel of mouse tissues at eight developmental stages from 10.5 days post
conception until birth.</p>

<p>
This track set presents enhancer-promoter interactions
predicted from enhancer-associated chromatin signals and gene expression across tissue stages,
based on histone modification (ChIP-seq), chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) 
and transcription (RNA-seq) assays and analysis performed by the ENCODE project.</p>
<p>
The promoter annotation in this track was obtained from the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://epd.epfl.ch/EPDnew_database.php">
Eukaryotic Promoter Database</a> (EPDNew).

<h2> Display Conventions and Configuration </h2>
<p>

This track is a multi-view composite track containing four data types
(<em>views</em>):
<ul>
<li>Enhancer elements</li>
<li>Promoter regions</li>
<li>Interactions between enhancers and gene promoter</li>
<li>Clustered interactions, by promoter or enhancer</li>
</ul>
<p>
For each view, there is a choice of two subtracks to display individually on the browser;
the full set of interactions (and component promoters and enhancers), and
a more stringent set, containing only interactions replicated in two biological
replicates.
Instructions for configuring multi-view
tracks are <a href="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" target=_blank>here</a>.</p>
<p>
The display aims to improve distinguishing genes and their interactions by coloring
successive genes in different colors.  All interactions with a gene are colored the
same as the gene.</p>
