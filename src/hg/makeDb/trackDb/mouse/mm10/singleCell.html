<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track contains selected datasets from single RNA-seq cell experiments. For each, a bar graph
with gene expression, exon-coverage and splice-junctions are available.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
As indicated by the &quot;...&quot; after its name, this is a 'super track', a container for other
tracks. There are three different types of tracks for each dataset:</a></p>

<p><b>Cell type expression:</b> A rectangle on the genome, at the location of a gene, filled
with a bar graph that indicates the gene's expression by single cell cluster. The term
"cluster" refers to a cluster of single cells. Usually this is a cell or tissue
type.</p>

<p><b>Coverage:</b> bar graphs indicate the number of reads at this base pair.
You may want to switch on auto-scaling of the y axis. For configuration
options, see <a
href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html">the graph
tracks configuration help page</a>. These tracks are shown in "dense" by default, set any of the tracks to "full" to see the detailed coverage plot.</p>

<p><b>Splice Junctions:</b> thick rectangles show exons around a splice site,
connected by a line that indicates the intron. These gaps are shown and are
annotated with the number of reads, in the 'score' field. You can use the
'score' filter on the track configuration page to show only introns with a
certain number of supporting reads. The maximum number of reads that are shown
is 1000, even if more reads support an intron. These tracks are shown in dense by default, set this track to "pack" to see. Then click the splice junctions to see their score.</p>

<p>
Converage and splice junctions are &quot;Views&quot;, which can be configured independently. See
the <a href="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" target="_blank">documentation on Multi-View
tracks</a>.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
BAM files were provided by the data submitters, one (single end) or two files (paired end) per
cell. The BAM alignments were used as submitted. They were merged with &quot;samtools merge&quot;
into a single BAM file per cluster. The readgroup (RG) BAM tag indicates the original cell.</p>

<p>
From the resulting merged BAM file, coverage was obtained using &quot;wiggletools coverage&quot; a
tool written by Daniel Zerbino and the result was converted with the UCSC tool
&quot;wigToBigWig&quot;.</p>

<p>
Also on the merged BAM file, the software IntronProspector was run with default settings. It
retains reads with a gap longer than 70 bp and shorter than 500 kbp and merges them into annotated
splice junctions.</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The merged BAM files, coverage bigWig files and splice junctions in bigBed format can be
downloaded from the <a href="https://cells.ucsc.edu/hubs/tabulamuris/">track hub directory</a>.</p>

<p>
Since the splice junction .bigBed files have their scores capped at 1000, the original
IntronProspector .bed files are available in the same
<a href="https://cells.ucsc.edu/hubs/tabulamuris/" target="_blank">track hub directory</a>. You can
also find there *.calls.tsv files with more details about each junction, e.g. the number of
uniquely mapping reads.</p>
