<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The ENCODE project has established an epigenomic resource for mammalian development,
profiling a diverse panel of mouse tissues at eight developmental stages from 10.5 days post
conception until birth.  This track set presents the results of a comprehensive study of chromatin
state across these developmental stages, based on 1,128 ChiP-seq assays of 8 histone modifications
in 12 tissues.</p>
<p>Histone modifications are chemical modifications (e.g. methylation, acetylation)
to the histone proteins present in chromatin; they influence gene expression
by changing how accessible the chromatin is to transcription.

<h2> Display Conventions and Configuration </h2>
<p>
This track is a multi-view composite track that containing two data types
(<em>views</em>).  For each view, there are multiple subtracks that
display individually on the browser.  Instructions for configuring multi-view
tracks are <a href="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" target=_blank>here</a>.
The views in this track are:
<dl>
<dt><em>Peaks</em></dt><dd> Regions of statistically significant signal
enrichment</DD>
<dt><em>Signal</em></dt><dd> Density graph of signal enrichment.</dd>
</DL>
<p>Peaks and signals displayed in this track are the results of merged replicates. </p>
<p>
Tracks are colored based on putative effect of the histone modification: red for repressive, ...

(Summary here)

<h2>Data Access</h2>

<p>Data from this and all phases of
86 ENCODE are publicly available through the ENCODE portal (https://www.encodeproject.org/)
</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>Histone ChIP-seq experiments in this track were performed by the Ren Lab (UC San Diego/Ludwig
Institute for Cancer Research) as part of the ENCODE Consortium (phase 3). The raw data were
processed by uniform pipelines provided by the ENCODE Analysis and Data Coordination centers.</p>
<p>
Thanks to David Gorkin at the Ren Lab for creating a track hub representing this data and
providing guidance during track development.
