<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The ENCODE project has established an epigenomic resource for mammalian development,
profiling a diverse panel of mouse tissues at multiple developmental stages from 10.5 days post
conception until after birth.
These tracks contain datasets relevant to the regulation of transcription derived from
multiple molecular assay types.</p>
