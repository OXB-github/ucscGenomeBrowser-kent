README for chm13v2.0 cytobands track conversion from hg38

The hg38 cytoBands track file was obtained from the UCSC Genome
Browser. Coordinates were first lifted over to chm13v1.0 using the chain file
hg38.t2t-chm13-v1.0.over.chain. Centromere band boundaries were placed at the
most distal ends of the active HOR array (or split HOR arrays, e.g. on chr3
and 4) on each chromosome. The p->q transition was placed at the midpoint
between these centromere band boundaries. Centromere-adjacent band coordinates
were adjusted to be contiguous. The last band on each chromosome was adjusted
to have its end position match the chromosome end position. For validation,
non-gap band sizes were confirmed to be preserved after liftover, and adjacent
band coordinates were checked to be contiguous, which was already true for
nearly all bands without any manual adjustment. One band (9q13) did not lift
over, so its distal boundary coordinate was set to preserve the length of the
neighboring 9q21.11 band relative to hg38, and its proximal 9q12-9q13 boundary
was set to be at the edge of the large HSat3 array. v1.1 coordinates were then
lifted over from v1.0 using the chain file v1.0_to_v1.1_rdna_merged.chain, and
rDNA stalk coordinates were manually adjusted to match the boundaries of the
rDNA arrays.

For chm13v2.0, the v1.1 coordinates were copied over for the autosomes and
chrX. For chrY, a liftover was attempted using the chain file
grch38-chm13_wfmash_p95s10k_26a.renamed.chain. However, most bands had to be
manually adjusted by aligning the 1 kb sequence surrounding each boundary in
hg38 to the chm13v2.0 chrY reference using BLAST. The Yq12 boundaries were
placed at the proximal end of the HSat1/3 super-array, and at the chromosome
end. Details of the conversion for each band are available in the spreadsheet
chm13v2.0_CytoBandMapping.xlsx.
