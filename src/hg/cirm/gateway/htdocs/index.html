              Welcome to the Stem Cell Hub web site. This contains high quality
              genomics data from a wide range of stem cell projects. It was built
              with funding from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine
              (CIRM), and includes all the data from two dozen labs participating in
              CIRM's Center of Excellence for Stem Cell Genomics as well as selected
              data from other relevant stem cell projects. It includes single cell
              RNA-seq data on naturally developing human tissues as well as cells
              engineered from healthy skin and blood cells to become replacements
              for diseased cells and tissues, including data from ethically and
              scientifically careful human clinical trials.
              <p class="card-text">
              The Stem Cell Hub combines state of the art software with careful
              human curation. The software runs quality checks that ensure the
              data is in the proper format, contains no contamination, that the DNA
              aligns in expected places, that the level of mitochondrial and
              ribosomal data are within expected range, and gathers statistics on
              how well replicates agree using a number of statistical measures. The
              system supports tagging

              the data using a flexible metadata system that
              allows experiments to be described in a concise but rich manner that
              reflects any natural hierarchies or control/experiment groups that are
              part of the experimental design. The human curators work with the
              contributing labs and the system to make sure that experiments are
              described consistently across labs and and that metadata tags exist to
              describe even new, leading edge assays. The Stem Cell Hub can be
              searched using either a faceted search or SQL like queries on the
              metadata. The Hub can restrict access to certain data to specific
              users to meet privacy requirements.

              <p class="card-text">
              We hope that the Stem Cell Hub will be useful to a wide range of
              scientists from clinicians to cell biologists to bioinformaticians
              doing custom analysis and combining data from multiple projects.
