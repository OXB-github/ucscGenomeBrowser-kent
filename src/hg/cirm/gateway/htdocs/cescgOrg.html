         target="_blank" class="standsout">CESCG<i class="fa fa-external-link"
         aria-hidden="true"></i></a> is to apply genomics and bioinformatics approaches
        to stem cell research to accelerate fundamental understanding of human biology
        and disease mechanisms, enhance cell and tissue production and advance
        personalized cellular therapeutics.</p>

        <p>
        The CESCG is composed of Operational Cores at

         target="_blank" class="standsout">the Salk Institute<i
         class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and a Data Coordination and Management
        Core at the University of California Santa Cruz, which currently support the following
        research programs:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Center-initiated Projects: Two projects are applying advanced genomics approaches,
              one to explore cardiac disease and drug toxicity and the other to investigate cell
              fate and identity. A third project is developing innovative bioinformatics tools
              to establish molecular network models and to guide predictions of cell fate.</li>
          <li>Collaborative Research Program: Through the solicitation and participation in
              collaborative research projects, the CESCG provides stem cell scientists throughout
              the state of California with access to cutting-edge genomics and bioinformatics
              technologies, and expertise and assistance in experimental design and data analysis.</li>
