The strex language is a small string expression evaluation language.  
This document describes its built in functions and operators:

+  - returns the concatenation of the surrounding strings.  Will convert a number to a string

[ix] - selects a character from string given an integer zero based index.

between(prefix, string, suffix) - returns the part of string found between prefix and suffix
   example:   between("abc", "01234abcHelloxyz56789", "xyz")  fetches just "Hello"
   If there are multiple places the prefix occurs, it will choose the first one, and the
   then the first place the suffix matches after that.  The biologist might think of it as
   a text oriented PCR, though the primer prefix and suffixes are not included in the output.
   The prefix "" corresponds to beginning of string and the suffix "" corresponds to end.

split(string, index)  - white space separated word from string of given 0 based index

separate(string, splitter, index) - separates string with splitter character. Returns 0 based index.

untsv(string, index) - separate by tab. Synonym for separate(string, '\t', index)

uncsv(string, index) - do comma separated value extraction of string. Includes quote escaping.

trim(string) - returns copy of string with leading and trailing spaces removed

md5(string) - returns an MD5 sum digest/hash of string. Useful for creating IDs

now() - returns current time and date in a really aweful unix ctime(2) format.  We will improve it.
